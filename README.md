# Migraine Tracker Project Plan

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Features

1. **Input Date**: Allow users to input the date of the migraine.
2. **Severity**: Allow users to rate the severity of the migraine (e.g., scale of 1-10).
3. **Location of Pain**: Allow users to describe where it hurts.
4. **Contributing Factors**: Allow users to input events or factors that might have contributed to the migraine.

### Steps

1. **Set Up Project**: Initialize a new project with necessary files and folders.
2. **Create Input Form**: Develop a form to capture the date, severity, location of pain, and contributing factors.
3. **Store Data**: Implement a way to store the input data (e.g., local storage, database).
4. **Display Entries**: Create a simple interface to display the recorded entries.

## Intermediate Stages

### Stage 1: Enhanced Data Visualization

#### Features

1. **Basic Charts**: Implement basic charts to visualize the frequency and severity of migraines over time.
2. **Filter Entries**: Allow users to filter entries by date range, severity, and location of pain.

#### Steps

1. **Chart Integration**: Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to display migraine data.
2. **Filtering Mechanism**: Develop a filtering mechanism to allow users to view specific subsets of their data.

### Stage 2: User Accounts and Data Sync

#### Features

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in.
2. **Data Sync**: Enable data synchronization across devices.

#### Steps

1. **Authentication System**: Set up a user authentication system (e.g., using Firebase Authentication).
2. **Data Sync Implementation**: Implement data synchronization to ensure users can access their data from multiple devices.

## Final Version

### Features

1. **Interactive Head Map**: Allow users to select specific areas on a head diagram to indicate where the pain is.
2. **AI Analysis**: Implement AI to analyze the data and identify trends.
3. **Trend Reports**: Generate reports showing trends over the previous week, month, and all time.
4. **Suggestions**: Provide suggestions based on the analysis to help manage migraines.

### Steps

1. **Interactive Head Map**: Develop an interactive head diagram for pain location selection.
2. **AI Integration**: Integrate AI tools to analyze the collected data.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Implement functionality to generate trend reports.
4. **Suggestions Engine**: Develop a system to provide suggestions based on the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (optional)
- **Database**: MongoDB, SQLite (optional)
- **AI Tools**: TensorFlow.js, Python (optional)

## Notes
